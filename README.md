Swift code snippets showing how to use each of the S.O.L.I.D Principles.

**** What are the S.O.L.I.D Principles?

The S.O.L.I.D Principles of Object Orientated Programming were developed by Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob).

The 5 parts of S.O.L.I.D refer to;

 - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
 - Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
 - Liskov’s Subsititution Principle (LSP)
 - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
 - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

These principles provide guidelines to help programmers build a more rubust modular software architecture.

Benefits of using the S.O.L.I.D Principles;

  - Helps avoid building code where making a change in one place breaks the code unexpectedly in others parts.
  - Promotes code reuse.
  - Makes code refactoring easier.
  - Makes writing automated software tests easier.
